# SupAut - (Dashboard)

## Project Description
SupAut is an all-you-need teacher's assistant, automating answering students' queries while providing concise progress of the student in a simple dashboard. Aimed to help the management of a SEN classroom, SupAut is both a culmination of a WhatsApp chat bot, and a business dashboard.

On one hand the chatbot intelligently communicates with your students, answering queries as well as tracking student skill while sending assigned assignment questions. While on the other hand, the dashboard displays the received information regarding answer details, and many other student skill related data, as well as perform many other functionalities. 

The application on the frontend is built using React.js which uses the CoreUI library to construct the dashboard, while integrating many Firebase products such as Firestore (database), Hosting (deployment), and Extensions (Twilio). Twilio (which is used to build the chatbot) itself is an incorporation of many services such as Autopilot (NLP), Functions and WhatsApp messaging API. Lastly the application also has a CI/CD pipeline which is handled by GitHub actions.
